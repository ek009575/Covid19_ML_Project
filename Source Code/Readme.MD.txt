Data Collection File is not working on Anaconda. You can only see the result by using visual studio code.
After I collected data and adjusted my dataset, the file has collapsed for no reason, which is why I also provided last version of my dataset. 
After collapsing of my data, I tried to comment out my code. However, there was a myriad of work in there so it made me difficult to make right comment out for me because
I could not examine every output on the file since every output is not visible owing to collapsed python file. Therefore, it affected me a lot while I was providing comments.
Original dataset has also been added to zip file
